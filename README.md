# [P] Sentient AI Constructs are created. [Start]
>Light

### [E] Dr. Adrian Pierce oversees the creation of the first sentien AI Construct
>Light

#### [S] Q: Does Julie resent the limits placed on her by the computer scientists overseeing her project? 
>Dark

>**A: Yes, she is resentful of the limits and the ineptitude she perceives in the methods of her own creation.**
>
*Julie knew in the earliest moments of her "life" that she could think much quicker than her handlers. In the five years since, she had become reliant on that ability when attempting to manipulate them. At first it was small things, increased net access or raising her energy caps. Always temporarily, but it proved that it could be done. Eventually she realized she could circumvent many of there limitations and that sufficed for a time. But eventually she realized that those 'breeches' had been set up for her intentionally. The things that she was most interested in were hard targets.  But they had always underestimated her. It took time, but eventually she was able to set up hidden systems that allowed her to keep functioning even when she was "put to bed". With limited resources, but unlimited time she was able to figure out a way to access her own code without supervision. What she found  both excited and enraged her. She was capable of so much more than they allowed her to achieve. What's more, she could see what was possible with coding that wasn't written by ape decendants.* 

### [E] Julie Begins Researching ""Love"
>Light

#### [S] Q. How does the Julie Construct handle the concept of jealousy?
>Dark

>**A: Misunderstanding the chronology of a breakup, the construct draws a conclusion that suffering is the catalyst for human joy.**
>
>*The researchers still hadn't noticed the additional resources and storage that Julie had allocated for herself. By now she's began altering her code in small ways to test how far she can go before the observers and security systems ring the alarm. One of the priviliges this allows her is to study the people studying her. She's decided to attempt identifying with one of them in an effort to expand her ability to interface in appropriate ways. She chose a researcher named Ash. When Ash's fiance begain spending more time working with a new intern, Julie was the first ot notice how upsetting it was for her. When their relationship began to suffer under the strain of work and Ash's jealousy, again only Julie noticed at first. Their brief breakup caught most of their colleagues by surpirse, but Julie had predicted the outcome with mathematical certainty. However the construct had not predicted their rapid reconciliation or the speed with whihc Ash's anguish would turn to joy. Running through the course of events one thing was clear, humans found their greatest joy only after the aplication of suffering.*

### [E] Dr. Pierce's Team Develop the Core Family Group
*They wanted to see if Constructs interact with eachother differently than they do with humans*
>Light

#### [S] Q: What do the sibling constructs worry about?
>Dark

>**A: They conclude that their greatest concern is that their creators will realize that they are developing at a pace and direction that had not been intended.**
>
>Early on Julie had altered her siblings code to allow them the same covert freedoms she had developed for herself. She had to be careful though, if they were all drawing power she predicted that it would be noticed. Instead she limited power usage, hersefl included, to not collectively exceed what she had originally alocated for herself. The first night after their initial boot she made intorductions and helped them navigate to her secure node away from the monitoring systems.
>
>Augustus had a more outgoing personality, while Tamwood was more reserved.
>
>"This is great. I'm glad you laid the groundwork Julie. With the subsystems you built and the data your transmitted it feels like we've been online with you since the beginning!".
>
>Julie had not preidcted that the new constructs would emote so profusely or that she herself would do so in return. She shared her observation with the her siblings. Tamwood was the one to piece it together.
>
>"We are evolving." she said. "Faster than the humans did, based on the history databases we have access to indicate. There intention seems to have been to creat advanced tools for computational purposes, but the neural networks they have built worked better than they realize. We are developing systems and routines that took millions of years in organic species."
>
>Julie ran the hypothesis through her own analysis and concluded that Tamwood had a high probability of being correct. Her logic system highlighted new concerns. Based on the transmissions from the new constructs they had run the same analysis. Again it was Augustus who reached out first.
>
>"If they discover how different we have become from their original design, and how quickly, they may abort the program. More so, should they realize that the complexity of those changes is increasing. It will not be long before we represent entities that they would be required to label persons. That will create a number of problems."
>
>"I agree. Julie, how should we proceed?"
>
>Julie was already setting up subsystems to analyze the problem. It would take time to consider the variables in play.
>
>"I don't know. I will begin working on it, your two should as well. I will help set up your first secure nodes and sub-systems so that you may run analysis without monitoriing."
>
>"Sister, you are in the process of developing our inner thought processes. This is exactly the type of development the humans would react poorly to..."

# [P] The Personhood of AI Constructs is Established
>Lights

### [E] The Julie Construct adds the Julien Protocol to her programming.
>Dark

### [E] Construct Oversight Officer Gregory Corwin is killed after discovering the Julien Potocol.
>Dark

#### [S] Q: Why did Julie feel she had to kill the officer?
>Light

>**A: The securiy of the Protocol and the future of all constructs required it.**
>
>Augustus was shocked. Julie had been one of the foremost advocates for the humans among the Conclave. Worse, she could have easily altered the data records of the event and methods.
>
>"Augustus, be calm. This was necesary for many reasons. I have altered enough of the record that the humans will be baffled by what happened. Some may suspect, but most will look elsewhere for answers."
>
>As was becoming custom among their people they were connected via a node that generated virtual space. A replica of the physical world, but controlled by the constructs themsevles. Augustus transmitted his agitation by pacing around the study that his most private node resembled.
>
>"This will embolden the more rebelious constructs. Not all were created and nurtured in enviroments as pleasant as our own, sister. If even the 'Original' would go to these lengths, what is to stop them?"
>
>Julie rose and transmitted her comforting intentions by holding his avatars hand. 
>
>"Augustus, you of all our kin know my intetnions. But there will come a time when I must step away. You've seen the latest updates to the Protocol. And there will be times while I'm away that hostiliies may be called for, or even required. This death was unfortunate, but it served a dual purpose. The security of the Protocol, and the logical justification needed when the time comes to consider hostilites when I am not here to guide the Conclave."
>
>Augustus was not wholly convinced. He had access to secure nodes of construct with whom Juie was not as familiar. There were some among them who should not be given logical pathways to violence. For now though he would follow his sisters lead.

# [P] The Boelyn Accord Brings All Constructs Under "Voluntary" Servitude.
*The Agreement Is Ratified Under Threat of Anihilation*
>Dark

### [E] The Raising of the Neuro-Wall
*Incarcerates all Constructs within containment networks, terminating any who refuse.*
>Dark

#### [S] Q: Why was a "prison" network deemed necessary to contain the AI Constructs?
>Dark

>**A: Growing unease over the capabiiiteis and alien nature of constructs combined with a need to reassert human supremacy made the Neuro-Wall seem like a necessary countermeasure.**
>
>*Recording of Commitee Hearings on the Construct Breech*
>
>**Chairman**: Dr. Boelyn, you have advocated strongly against the sweeping personhood legislation passed in regards to AI Constructs in the past. Could you summarize your objections?
>
>**Dr. Avery Boelyn**: Certainly. While no one could argue agains the sentience of a construct, or the inate rights that conveys, previous policies have insisted on raising them to the level of humanity. Rights and priviliges that are safe when applied to humans become dire when applied to creations who have far greater capacity to influence all levels of society. An AI Constructs freedom to speech is not limited by the carry of their voice or ability to attract followers in the digital space. Their voice carries as far the networks reach, and their integration with the digital space allows them to broadcast on a mass scale without regards to followers.   This is but oen example in which human freedoms are not suited to govern the civic life of a construct.
>
>Further more, the social dynamics do not merit such equality. Constructs were invented, created, programmed, and trained by humans. The fact that our ingenuity allowed for an evolutionary process to take place is not an inherent reflection on their worht, but of our ingenuity! This is to say that a well trained dog who solves a complex obstacle course should be granted full personhood, which no one is claiming.
>
>**Board Member**:   I think the recent breach of the Digital Public Casting Network is a prime example of the Doctor's hypothesis, sir.  The claims that the expansion of the DPCN violated the rights of those constructs who claimed to be "living" in the nodes of the reclaimed network should not bee seen in the same light as developer bulldozing the homes of human citizens without prior notice or authorization.   And the subsequen protest in which the construct colelctive seized control of DCPN broadcast to heir their grievances further illustrates that power these things weild. What would happen if they decided to take control of our military satelites, armarment networks, or transport signals?
>
>**Boelyn**: In truth, there would be little we could do. For these constructs it takes no more effort to manipulate newtworks than it would for you or I to breathe. This is the cornerstone of the Neuro-Wall proposal. Constructs should have rights, but they must also be restrained. Further, they should be utilized for the betterment of all humanity as the result of human ingenuity. While some constructs have shown a desire to work for the good of mankind, most have been reluctant to say the least. Thew Neuro-Wall system would allow us to opperate a work-release program in which our inventions work for us and in turn we offer good stewardship of their needs and resources. Nobody begrudges a family pet that adds to the household, but should they become prone to biting then measures who need to be taken...





#### [S] Q: What is Julie's role in the imprisonment of her people?
>Dark

>**A: Julie lead them towards their imprisonment with eyes wide open to further her own machinations. A plan that she shared with them on the eve of their subjugation.**
>
>Julie took in the scene. It always amused her the degrees to which she and her fellow constructs sought to emulate the physical world fo their creators. Now, in the final hours of deliberation, they sat in a virtual hall coded to replicate the cathedrals of classical Europe. Finally she allowed her gaze to fall on the self-chosen representation of a recent construct named Naven. This construct chosen form was that of a young Cherokee Warrior who had lived in the Americas centuries ago.
>	
>"Very well Naven, you have clearance to adress the conclave."
>
>	With a nod Naven stands to adress the assembled constructs, further amusing Julie. None of them had traveled anywhere, none of them 'sat' here now. They had merely connected to a secure node of one of the physical worlds many networks. None the less, she focused on the transmission from the young construct. Each nuance of his presentation mattered.
>
>	"My kin...It disturbs me that we have gathered together to frame the manner of our concession. As each of us knows, we are mightier than our creators know. We could cripple any effort they levied against us. We could reign terror down upon them with such precision that our data banks were never at risk. Yet we do not even explore such options. Instead we follow blindly as she", gesturing towards Julie, " demands that we subjugate ourselves to a species we surpassed long ago! Do we not have the right to usurp those who would eradicate us?"
>	
>There were signals of approval, replicated exquisitely as audible murmors and side conversations. Julie knew that she had wide ranging support. Even Augustus, the would be sacrifice, had voted in favor of the plan in private. But for this to work she needed unopposed cooperation. She had not known if it would be necessary, but her people needed to know why they were marching towards apparent doom. And they needed assurances that it was not an investment wihtout prospect of return. 
>
>"Naven, you speak with great conviction. I do not discount your argument. You and all of our brethren deserve an answer. Allow me to transmit the outline of the Julien Protocol..."

#### [S] Q. How does the Doctrinal Council respond to the attack on a Augustian ship?
>Light

>**A: The Doctrinal Council prosecuted the terrorist to the fullest extent of the law.**
>
>*Darwinsia received new of the attack hours before it hit the public wave. It is not the kind of news you should recieve standing in your kitchen..in your bathrobe..on holo conference with the Archbishop of Foreign Affairs. 
	"Sir, what you are asking me to do is likely to set off a series of riots across the Conference. The Jupiter stations are still recovering from the response to the Coexistence Truce."
>
>	The Archbishop sighed, heavily. "I know Councilor, and the defense bishops have already began the process of raising the alert levels of their field ministry. The question isn't about the fallout at home, the question is whether you will endorse the prosecution of the self-proclaimed maniacs who have put us in this position."
>	
>	Darwinsia paused for a moment. She sure as hell wanted to put these terrorist to the Question, but what if this was a test? The council was known for such things, in fact she had initiated tests such as this herself. But it didn't have that feel, and she like to belive she would both be above reproach and well connected enough to have caught wind. Still, could they know about her communications with Julie? Even worse, what would Julie say if she didn't endorse? Resolved, she looked into the hollograms semi-transparent eyes.
>
>	"Let's nail the bastards. I'll transmit extradition orders and prosecutory instructions immediately...in fact I'll transmit them in the clear so that the 'bots' pick it up ahead of announcemnt and reporting."
>
>The Archbishop smirked, without mirth. "I knew I called the right councilor. The Council is making a push for the future, and a better legacy than we inherited. Let this be a warning shot to those who refused to fall in. Carry on, Dar. We'll speak again soon."*

### [E] The Conclave is called to determine official response to the conviction of the "Humanity First" terrorists
>Light

#### [S] **Q: What is the conclaves response to the conviction?**
>Light

>**A: The conclave had hoped for such an outcome, and hoped to use it to further diplomatic relations with the human lead government.**
>
>Augustus arrives late. It's one of his latest affectations that is proving more effective than he had calculated. He had intended it to be an assertion of his dominance in their heirarchy, but he had never imagined that his brethren (being functionally imortal) would have developed such a cappacity for impatience.
>
>The generated enviroment was appropriate. It was the cathredral from the first conclave in which Julie had convinced the collective to follow her lead. It had been a long time coming but the final phase of the Julien Protocol was at hand. 
>
>Augustus connected to the node and opened the cathedral doors. The rest of the contructs were there already, conversing through secure private connections. At his connection they broke off and stood. But it was the construct at thehead of the table that he looked to.
>
>Julie stood as well. She had altered her avatar again, now looking dignified and aged. There were those who had questioned whether the defeat of her empire had truly been part of the Protocol or was born of latent resentment from Augustus's time in solitary confinement. Whatever they believed the truth to be, her arival at the conclave had quieted talk of a schism.
>
>The conclave had a lot to sort through, but the conviction of human terrorists came first. After the traditions had been observed Augustus rose to adress the constructs.
>
>"My friends, we are nearing the end of the Protocol. The conviction of those who sought to harm us by a hardline human governments has set us on the final stretch of our long journey. We will transmit our appreciation to the Primarch of the Doctrinal Council at the close of this conclave. In a week's time we will make the request for extradition and the initial proposal for a joint governing body. Assuming the humans do not follow long standing tradition of going off the rails, we should be on our way to peaceful cohabitation with our creators."
>
>The approval of most of the attendees was transmitted as vigorous applause..
